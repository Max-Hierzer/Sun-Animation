# Sun-Animation

Sun-Animation is a simple visualization tool that simulates the movement of the sun and calculates the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) panel based on its position on a map, azimuth, and tilt. The application helps users understand how the orientation and location of a PV panel affect its energy production throughout the day.

## Features

- Interactive sun animation showing the sun’s path across the sky.
- Power graph that visualizes the estimated energy output of a PV panel.
- Adjustable panel parameters: location (via map), azimuth, and tilt.
- Uses real-world map data for accurate simulation.

## Usage

1. Select a location on the map to place your PV panel.
2. Adjust the azimuth and tilt to match your panel’s orientation.
3. View the sun’s path and the corresponding power output graph.
